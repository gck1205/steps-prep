data catalogue:
Linking of Technical metadata with --> Business metadata using Tags

1) First create tag template :
    Add column details such as source,volume,has_pii, pii_type

2) Apply policy on top of the tags/tag templates:
    policy tags can be applied at  column level
  Taxonomies needs to be defined before applying policy tags
  Eg:
  Highly Confidential -- SSN

  Medium Confidential - Address

3) set IAM permissions based on policy tags

4) Users without access cannot query restricted columns

Taxonomy - its a container where you organise policy tags into a hierarchy
In BQ table, under Edit Schema : Add policy Tag --> assigning as highly confidentail or Medium Confidential
