================================

Pub/Sub is an asynchronous global messaging service. 

There are three terms in Pub/Sub that appear often: topics, publishing, and subscribing.

A topic is a shared string that allows applications to connect with one another through a common thread.

Publishers push (or publish) a message to a Pub/Sub topic. 


Subscribers will then make a subscription to that thread, 
where they will either pull messages from the topic or configure webhooks for push subscriptions.
 Every subscriber must acknowledge each message within a configurable window of time.

In sum, a publisher creates and sends messages to a topic and a subscriber creates a subscription
 to a topic to receive messages from it.

Pub/Sub comes preinstalled in Cloud Shell, so there are no installations or configurations
required to get started with this service. 
In this lab you use Python to create the topic, subscriber, and then view the message. 
You use a gcloud command to publish the message to the topic.
